    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Gustav. I am a hobbyist programmer and student who is
      passionate about programming. I am mainly a C++ programmer but I enjoy
      to learn new software stacks and their potential. As most C++
      programmers, I do care about speed. My goal by writing my own software
      is to optimize it to my needs. Most of my work is completely open source
      and available at <a href="https://github.com/GustavJones">My Github</a>.

    <h1>About this project</h1>

    <p>
      This website is one of my hobby projects to simplify the management of
      my photos in a web library. It is written in C++ from the operating
      system up (using operating system sockets for connection). It uses
      OpenSSL for TLS and HTTPS for secure connections.
